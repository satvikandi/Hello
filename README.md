## Steps to Deploy :

### 1. The ability to configure a deployment environment automatically using a configuration management tool

We have used AWS "CloudFormation" service along with Jenkins configurations to create an automatic deployment environment. 

We use a template file to configure the EC2 instance that CloudFormation creates.

On Jenkins, we use the **"Publish over SSH"** plugin to SSH into our EC2 instance to carry out our pre and post build actions.

In the pre-build step, we SSH into the EC2 instance and set the commands to install nodejs as follows :

'nodejs' and 'npm' get installed after this step

### 2. The ability to deploy the application on the remote instances after the build step

In the Jenkins post-build actions, we set the commands to install the dependencies required to run our javascript application **app.js** on our Production server.

The dependencies are resolved using the npm install command :

The application is run using the *'forever start command'*

Now, app.js has been deployed on the production server.


### 3. Remote Deployment

We have 2 remote EC2 insatnces running that we can SSH into :

We can see app.js running on http://52.5.198.199:5000/

### 4. Canary Release

For our Canary release, as a Jenkins pre-build step, we have configured another EC2 instance for our canary release similar to our production server.

The build ensures the app_canary is deployed on the canary server

We can see the app_canary.js running on Canary server i.e http://52.5.160.173:5000/

### 5. Canary Analysis

We use the app to monitor CPU and memory utilization on the canary server periodically. This app runs on http://52.5.160.173:3000/. The default app running here is the production app i.e. app.js.

The threshold to kill the canary has been set to 90 for the CPU utilization. The canary is killed once this threshold is crossed.
